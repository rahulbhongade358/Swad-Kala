            <h2>Method:</h2>
            <p> To make the batter, place a sieve over a bowl & sieve in the gram flour, further add 
                water in batches while whisking it continuously to make a lump free, thin & smooth 
                batter.Once the batter is ready, pour it into a pining bag & tie a knot to the open 
                end of it.Now to fry the moti / small pearls, heat oil to 170C or until moderately hot.
                Once the oil is moderately hot, cut the tip of the pipingbag to make a very fine hole 
                then hold the piping bag over the kadhai & squeeze it gently, this will produce a 
                stream of small droplets that will fall directly into the hot oil.Fry the pearls medium 
                flame until light golden brown, make sure you don't fry them too much.Once fried, 
                transfer the motis into a sieve using a ladle & gently give a jerk to the sieve to 
                remove any excess oil.Further transfer the fried motis from the sieve into a tissue 
                paper lined bowl & fry all the motis similarly & let them cool down completely, your 
                motis / pearls for motichoor laddu are ready.To make the sugar syrup firstly add the 
                food colour & water into a bowl & stir it well to dissolve the colour.Take a pan & add 
                the sugar into it along with the prepared coloured water & switch on the flame to high, 
                stir well & cook until the sugar dissolves.Once the sugar dissolves completely switch 
                off the flame & add all the fried motis into the pan & mix it well with sugar syrup.
                When all the motis get combined with the sugar syrup switch on the gas flame & cook the 
                mixture over low flame until all the sugar syrup is absorbed by the motis, add in a 
                tablespoon of hot water if you feel like the mixture is getting dry.Once all the sugar 
                syrup is absorbed, switch off the flame, cover the pan & let the mixture rest for 
                10 minutes.After the mixture has rested, transfer it into a large bowl & add ghee along 
                with the melon seeds & mix gently, let the mixture cooldown till it reaches room 
                temperature.To shape the laddus, take a spoonful of the mixture & form it into a 
                roundel using your hands, shape all the remaining mixture similarly.Your motichoor 
                laddus are ready, garnish them with varak & chopped pistachio.</p>
